\## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease using medical and lifestyle attributes through machine learning classification models.



\## Dataset Description

The Cardiovascular Disease dataset contains over 70,000 patient records with 12 clinical and behavioral features. The target variable indicates whether a patient has cardiovascular disease.
